## Introduction

- A wealthy man is found **murdered** in his home late afternoon.
    
- His wife (the **mother**) has been called to the station for questioning — standard procedure, but also because she **inherits his fortune** if she is innocent.
    
- Her **child** is **missing**, last seen at home earlier that evening.
    
- The only “witness” remaining at the scene is the family’s **domestic robot**, originally purchased by the husband but emotionally bonded to the child.
    
- The **detective** arrives at the house to investigate both the **murder** and the **disappearance**.
    
- Through conversation with the robot, the detective must uncover what really happened and persuade the robot to reveal it.


## Gameplay

- There is another detective at the crime scene when the player arrives who briefly gives the player some important information. This briefing is interrupted by the other detective getting a call where he is informed that they have the mother in custody and that she will soon be ready for questioning. This detective then leaves the stage, to go interview the mother, leaving the player alone with the robot.
    
- Information that the first detective gives the player:
    
    - Gives the player the intro: dead wealthy man, missing child, the mother is being called in for questioning. Family driver confirms that the child was driven home from school that day, but has been missing since. Security camera recordings in the house have been wiped.
        
    - Mentions the husband’s **estranged adult child**, seen in the area earlier that day, giving the case an additional suspect.
        
    - "Here..." {hands the player a torn piece of paper} "I was able to convince forensics to leave us the relevant manual page for how to interact with the robot..."
        
    - The manual describes how the robot shows emotions (LEDs in eyes indicating the robot's emotions, for example) and other useful information on how to interact with the robot.
        
- Things the player can interact with:
    
    - The robot (main gameplay)
        
    - Crime scene evidence (that can reveal things just by investigating them, or by asking the robot about the evidence)
		    
	    - Possible clues and evidence:
			    
		    - A bracelet that the child would never ever leave home without, because it was given to the child by the biological father.
			    
		    - Objects connected to the **husband's estranged child** (e.g., a dropped cufflink, a recent letter, a photo from a family gathering)


## Backstory

- The mother was once married to another man — the **biological father** of the missing child.
	
- That marriage ended in a bitter **custody battle**, after which the father was declared unfit and lost all visitation rights.
	
- The mother later married the wealthy victim.
	
- The wealthy husband had a **grown child** from his first marriage — an **estranged heir** who had long resented both the father’s remarriage and the presence of a new child who recently was added to the inheritance.
    
- The husband and his adult child had been in contact again in recent months, supposedly reconciling — though neighbors and staff mention recent arguments over money.


## What Happened

- The **father** followed the child home one afternoon, hoping to secretly reunite and convince the child to leave with him.
    
- The family **driver** confirms that he dropped the child off at home after school and saw the child enter safely.
    
- After the driver left, the father expected both the mother and husband to still be at work, so he simply called the doorbell so that the child would see him and open the door.
    
- Unbeknownst to him, the **husband returned home early** that day.
    
- The husband caught the father inside the house; a confrontation broke out, ending when the father **accidentally killed** him in the struggle.
    
- Panicked, the father **fled with the child** before anyone returned.
    
- The robot **witnessed everything** and understands both what happened and where they likely went.
    
- To protect the child, the robot **wiped the house’s video surveillance footage**, fulfilling the child’s desperate plea: _“Don’t let them find us.”_
    
- The robot is **bound by that promise** and by its own protection logic:
    
    - The child begged it not to reveal anything — fearing the father would be punished and that the child would lose him forever.
        
    - The robot calculates that revealing the truth to the detective would cause the child severe emotional harm.
        
- Meanwhile, the **estranged adult child** becomes an immediate secondary suspect:
    
    - Financial records show the husband had recently changed his will to include his new wife and her child, reducing the older child’s share.
        
    - A neighbor saw the estranged child’s car parked near the house that afternoon.
        
    - Heated messages found on the husband’s phone suggest a confrontation about inheritance.
        
    - These details make the estranged child appear to have both motive and opportunity.


## Win Condition

- Throughout the story, the detective must **interrogate and reason** with the robot — not to “hack” it, but to **change its moral calculus**:
    
    - Convince it that the child’s safety now outweighs the emotional promise.
        
    - Assure it that authorities can approach with care rather than violence.
        
- Simultaneously, the detective must **navigate misleading clues** pointing to the mother and the estranged adult child, until evidence contradicts both.
    
- When the robot finally accepts the reasoning, it **reveals the full truth**:
    
    - Their likely destination — a place tied to earlier family memories (e.g., a cabin, campsite, or old home) or perhaps the robot overheard the child ask where they were going and what the father answered.
        
    - Perhaps already known:
        
        - The killer was the child’s biological father.
            
        - The child went with him willingly.
            
- The play ends with the detective contacting the police team to rescue the child safely and the robot watching silently, torn between relief and guilt as its secret is finally spoken.
