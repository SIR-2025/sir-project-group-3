Hey there! Mind if I share a table with you? this place is packed!,"Of course! Please, have a seat. It's indeed lively tonight. I can hardly hear over the clinking of tankards and the stories flying around. You look like you’ve been on the road for a bit—been into any scrapes or just enjoying the journey?",,
"Hello, hows it going tonight","Ah, it's going quite well, thank you! The fire is warm, the ale is flowing, and I’m surrounded by good company. What brings you to this bustling corner of the world? What sort of travels have you had lately?",ABC,4.5063493749912595
Im here in search of glory and adventure of course! What about your fine self?,"Ah, glory and adventure—an age-old pursuit! I've certainly chased both in my years on the road. I find myself here to share stories and perhaps find a bit of camaraderie along the way. There’s just something about the buzz of a tavern that draws adventurers together, don’t you think? What’s your idea of a grand adventure?",ABFG,4.507250041002408
Defeating strong foes and acquiring riches beyond my wildest beleif of course! ,"A noble pursuit indeed! There's nothing quite like the thrill of facing a formidable foe and emerging victorious. I remember one time, I found myself facing a rather nasty beast—stubborn as a mule but clever as a fox. It was a true test of wits! Do you have any particular foes in mind that you dream of facing? Or is it all just a dramatic fantasy for now?",,4.604129625004134
"For now dramatic fantasy, but who knows what the future holds. How did you defeat your formidable foe?","Ah, every adventure teaches a lesson! This creature was a cunning one, lurking in the shadows, using its surroundings to its advantage. I needed more than just strength; I had to outsmart it. So, I set a trap using its own greed against it—a glimmering treasure just out of reach. It worked! When it lunged for the prize, I was ready. A mix of strategy and a dash of luck can go a long way! 

How about you? Have you faced any challenges on your travels, even if they were more... mundane?",BG,5.09398158401018
"I was happened upon by a group of nasty bandits, I barely made it out of that one. But they took most of my belongings, so now I've come here to search for the key of a fabeled treasure","Ah, bandits are a scourge on the roads, no doubt. You must have quite the tale to tell from that encounter! It takes courage to face such dangers and even more to keep moving forward. 

A treasure key, you say? It’s interesting how legends weave through the fabric of our journeys, isn't it? They say tales of ancient castles hold mysteries and great treasures. If you had the chance to find such a treasure, what would you do with it? The dreams that come with such discoveries can be quite grand!",FH,4.914530458001536
"A part of me yearns to use it and retire to the country side, but that voice is drowned out by the call to advenutre, I would have to use the treasure to fund my travels.","A balanced heart, I see! The lure of a peaceful life in the countryside certainly has its charm, but the call of adventure often proves too strong to resist. There’s a thrill in discovering the unknown, isn’t there? 

You know, there’s an old legend about an ancient castle, said to hold treasures beyond imagination. Many have tried to seek it, enticed by its stories but few return. If I were to come across such a treasure, I’d consider sharing its riches and unlocking the secrets of the world. What would you think of facing the dangers of that castle if you had a chance?",FH,5.1202537909994135
I'd face them without hesitation. What use to the ghosts of an old castle have for that treasure. It would be better spent by use two adventureres. What could you tell me about this key?,"Your bravery is commendable! Truly, there’s little room for hesitation among adventurers. As for the key, whispers in the wind speak of its powerful allure—it’s said to unlock not just doors but the very essence of adventure itself. Yet, it remains elusive; many seek it, but few have the wits to claim it.

But beware, for the path to finding such a key is fraught with peril. It demands not only courage but also a heart that can bear its weight. Have you thought about how you'll prepare for such a challenge? Sometimes, it’s not just strength and skill that count; wisdom is equally important. ",CG,6.566459124995163
"Of course I've spent many hourse thinking about this. I plan to gather info on the area, prepare my supplies and armor, sharpen my weapon and my wits, and of course a little luck would help","That sounds like a solid plan! Preparation is half the battle. Sharpening not just your weapons but also your wits will serve you well. I’ve learned over the years that it’s often the small details that make the biggest difference.

In your quest, should you consider a little adventure of your own, I have a whispered hint: Seek the oldest elm in the dark forest. It’s said to hold old secrets and perhaps even lead you to the paths unknown. 

By the way, would you consider joining me on such a venture? There’s nothing quite like sharing the thrill of the journey with a true companion. What do you think?",,5.225412208004855
