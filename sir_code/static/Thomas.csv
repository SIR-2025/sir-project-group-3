Hey there! Mind if I share a table with you? this place is packed!,"Of course, welcome! It’s always nice to share a table with a fellow wanderer. I see the road’s been kind of hard on you. Long journey, I take it? What brings you to this bustling little corner of the world?",,
"I'm an adventurer! Long journey indeed. What about yourself? Judging by your impressive outfit, I'd venture to guess you are an adventurer too!","Ah, you’ve got a keen eye! Yes, I’ve been on quite a few adventures myself. This old outfit has seen its fair share of dust and stories. There’s something about the call of the open road, isn’t there? What sort of exploits have you embarked on in your travels?",ABCG,4.913217416004045
"Ah, yes, the open road calls upon us travellers in a special way, a keen observation you make there! On my previous journey I wanted to befriend a cheetah. Turns out, they are not all that different from housecats; they pur and meaow and have just as big of a desire to be rubbed behind their ear as our feline companions. Incredible, it was! But this journey, the one I am on now, is quite different...","A cheetah, you say? That's quite the undertaking! I can only imagine the surprise of witnessing such a majestic creature with a heart so similar to our smaller companions. It sounds like you’ve a knack for making unexpected friends.

And I gather that this current journey holds different challenges and perhaps more intrigue? What is it that you seek on this adventure—treasure, knowledge, or perhaps something altogether different?",ABFH,5.420791166005074
"What kind words! Not unlike yourself, I must say. You seem like you would have made many friends on your past journeys. Say, you might even be making one right now, don't you think? But yes, indeed, you are very observant, this journey poses different challanges. I have heard rumors of a special place,  some even say a magical place, a place where a treasure can be unveiled for the brave and worthy. But enough about me, I am talking your ear off, I want to hear more about you. What is it that you are seeking on this journey you are on now?","Ah, what a lovely sentiment—making friends along the way is indeed one of the greatest treasures of our travels! As for what I seek, well, it’s a bit of a tapestry. Each thread holds its own stories: the thrill of exploration, the wisdom of experiences, and perhaps a hint of adventure that still bubbles beneath the surface.

With each journey, I find that my heart leans towards gathering tales, both joyous and cautionary, from fellow adventurers. They often guide my next steps. Have you always followed whispers of legend and treasure, or do you seek something deeper, perhaps a purpose or a calling?",ABCGH,5.526867749998928
"Wisdom, eh? How lovely! I find the spiritual journeys to be the most fulfilling, wouldn't you say? Indeed, your discernment is strong, this is not just about treasure-hunting, I have a higher purpose here. I'm sad to say that my village has fallen into desperation, tragedy after tragedy has befallen us. I hope that this treasure, if it is as valuable as the legend suggests, can help rebuild our village back up to the strength it once had. We are good people. For many years we have helped the ones in need, but now we are weak and can barely muster the strength and resources to help ourself.  It makes me sad, but that is also why this journey is so invigorating! Can you imagine the strength you feel when your purpose is as good as mine? Oh, here I go agaiin, rambling and rambling. What about you? Do you have people you would give your everything to?","Your purpose is truly noble, and I can feel the weight of your village's burden in your words. It takes a strong spirit to seek out solutions amid despair. I admire that kind of heart—a treasure far more valuable than gold or jewels. 

As for me, I have had companions who felt like family, bonds forged in the fires of adventure and camaraderie. There’s an old saying that rings true: ""Friendship is the anchor in stormy seas."" While my own circle may be scattered over lands both far and near, they remain a part of my journey, and I would go to great lengths to ensure their safety and happiness.

Speaking of treasures, I’ve heard whispers in the tavern about an ancient castle that’s cloaked in mystery—rumors speak of dangers within, but also of a rich history and potential fortunes for those brave enough to seek it. What do you think? If you stumbled into such a place, what would you do with a treasure found there?",BFH,7.395337708003353
"You don't say! Oh, this is great, do you think it is the same treasure I have heard of? It would all go to my village of course... and my fellow journeyman. I always share with my kindred spirits, the ones who can always hear the road calling for them. Ah, forgive me for being so forward, you have gotten me all energised, but don't you want to go see this place? I have been travelling alone this far, but I yearn for a fellow brave soul to face the unknownwith. Should we go together? It would be safer for us both too!","Your enthusiasm is infectious! There’s a certain magic that comes alive when speaking of adventure, isn’t there? It sounds like your heart is set on the treasure, and I can certainly see why—helping your village rebuild speaks volumes about your character.

As for the castle, the allure is undoubtedly strong. I’ve faced my share of unknowns and know the value of a trusty companion. But remember, such places are often fraught with danger, and not every whisper of treasure is what it seems.

Before we decide to join forces on this journey, it’s wise to consider what we might encounter. Courage is vital, but so is preparation. Have you heard any specific tales about the castle? Perhaps I know more than meets the eye, if we’re to tread there together.",BEFGH,5.687317667005118
"No, I haven't had the chance to do much reconnaissance yet, that was actually my next step. Was about to start just after I had a wee rest. Do you know much about these fantastic tales that are circulating? I can see that look in your eye, something tells me you know more than anyone here! Oh, that makes me so intrigued. Please do tell, let your wisdom flow, I am your student and you are my master. Tell me, what is the wisest approach? We are brave and strong, but we must also be smart! It is dangerous as you say, so caution is imperative.","Ah, the allure of wisdom—the search for knowledge is just as vital as the strength we possess! You’re right to seek out every scrap of information before diving into the unknown. It’s a shrewd approach. 

As for the tales, I’ve indeed heard whispers about the castle shrouded in mist, said to guard treasures both material and arcane. Many who were drawn to its allure have emerged changed… or not at all. It is wise to tread carefully, for the ancients have a way of testing the hearts of those who seek their riches.

And should you find yourself in pursuit, I would suggest seeking the oldest elm in the dark forest nearby. They say it holds secrets of the land and may guide the worthy in their quest. 

If you'd like, I’d be happy to share more tales when you return from your reconnaissance. But remember, whether we face it together or apart, every journey must begin with a single step. Let your purpose guide you!",ABCGH,6.722888250005781
